Project Overview:
ENHYPEN Official Website
All things related to ENHYPEN's latest comeback, member profiles, music videos, reality shows, and all their albums details. This website aims to provide fans with a centralized platform where they can access comprehensive information, engage with the latest updates, and immerse themselves in the world of ENHYPEN.

Design Process
I created this website with Enhypen fans in mind catering to their desire for comprehensive and up-to-date information. 
Some user stories that guided our design process:
- As a fan, I want to explore Enhypen's latest albums, so that I can stay updated on their music.
- As a new fan, I want to learn more about each member's profile, so that I can connect with them individually.
- As a dedicated viewer, I want information about Enhypen's reality shows, so that I can follow their journey behind the scenes.
- As a music enthusiast, I want to discover and listen to tracks from Enhypen's new comeback, so that I can enjoy their latest music.

Exiting Features:
- Album Section - Allows users to explore details about Enhypen's latest albums, including release dates, tracklists, and concept photos.
